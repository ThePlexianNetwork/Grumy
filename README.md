## Introduction

Grumy is a simple 2D tile based game about placing and breaking tiles. From 
physics to character sprites, Grumy tries to be unique and simple.

## Building

Currently everything you need to build Grumy is included in this repository.
All you need to do is clone it and press the "Run" button in Eclipse.

*Please note that all the neccesiary libraries and natives are loaded at runtime
by the launcher. Just make sure that the "lib" folder is available in the Grumy
directory*
