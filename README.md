# Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Pendulum repository!

Basically, this is the repository for Pendulum. All the code and assets for the game are stored here. Honestly you won't find much about the plans here, instead check in the [Pendulum category](http://plexian.org/c/pendulum) on the [Plexian website](http://plexian.org).

This code is all written by the Plexian Programming team, and uploaded here. Check out the [nightly builds](http://files.plexian.org/Pendulum/nightly).
